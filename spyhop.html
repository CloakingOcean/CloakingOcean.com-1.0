					<h1>What is SpyHop?</h1>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spyhop.org">SpyHop</a> is a great organization with the main goal of helping teenagers express themselves through media. They hold apprenticeships for Audio, Design (Game Design), and Film. I've been to two of their Design apprenticeships and hope to come back and do more.</p>
					</br>
					<h1>What did you do?</h1>
					</br>
					<h2>2014</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of other teens and I designed and developed a Game in <a href="http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=CLmmoM7arMcCFYqPfgodP-AN5w">Unity</a>.
					For the first apprenticeship we created a infinite runner game with food collectables. The goal was to collect healthy foods while avoiding junk food and obstacles. For the second one we had the <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11653">Ferr2D</a> project for the base and we changed and modified it to our needs. This one was a 2D platfomrer with the player being a green booger-like blob. For the controls, the player would click on the screen and the blob would shoot in the direction of the mouse. For an example, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2985443/Demos/Ferr2DTGrassDemo/Ferr2DTGrassDemo.html">click here</a>. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<h2>2016</h2>
					<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year my experience at Spy Hop was very different than the previous years. 
					First of all, the program wasn't only focused on game development, it was more focused on designing with art programs. 
					The programs we worked with were Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, and Cinema4D. We learned about 2D-Animation, 
					created our own tutorials for Spy Hop's new youtube channel (<a href="">Click here for that</a>), and attempted a personal 
					project which challenged our own abilities (Soon To Come). 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all that we had a few months to work on a video game. 
					We decided to make a game based around history that teaches you about American history and their dates. (Soon to Come) 
					We used a package called Acrocatics that had most of our mechanics implemented already, and since our group was mostly 
					made of artists and not programmers, this worked out very well.

					The end product was very colorful and a minimalistic 2D design.
